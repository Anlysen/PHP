Recent changes in real services and goods spending have been extraordinary (figure A). 
With the onset of the pandemic, real spending on services shrunk by 20 percent between 
February and April 2020. Spending partly bounced back in the third quarter, with consumption 
of services in September just 8 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Since the fourth quarter 
of 2020, spending on services has grown 1.7 percent each quarter, on average. Nonetheless, 
a simple extrapolation of the pre-pandemic trend in services spending shows that it is still
 well below trend. In contrast, spending on consumer goods soared after a brief contraction.
